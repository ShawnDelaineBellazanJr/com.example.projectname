# ThoughtTransfer: Self-Referential MCP Framework

## Overview

ThoughtTransfer is a comprehensive framework for **self-referential, evolutionary software development** that embodies **PMCR-O loop principles** (Plan, Make, Check, Reflect, Optimize). It uses the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** to integrate AI tools, structured outputs for portability, and a declarative intent system for reproducible, bounded workflows.

## 🧠 Core Philosophy & Ideal

The framework's ideal is to create **living, self-improving systems** that can:
- **Self-assess** their own quality and completeness
- **Evolve** through iterative optimization
- **Orchestrate** complex workflows deterministically
- **Maintain provenance** and locked context across runs
- **Scale** from simple tool calls to full application development

It draws from:
- **PMCR-O**: A 5-step loop for continuous improvement
- **O-dash-O topologies**: Chain/Tree/Graph/Orchestrator/Optimizer patterns
- **Strange loops & self-reference**: Systems that observe and modify themselves
- **Intent programming**: Declarative specifications that generate executable plans

## 🏗️ Architectural Components

### 1. C# MCP Client (ProjectName.McpClient)
- **Purpose**: Executes intent JSONs against MCP servers, handles templating, and produces structured outputs
- **Key Features**:
  - Multi-call execution with `{{last.Text}}` templating
  - Server overrides via CLI (`--server`, `--serverArgs`)
  - Structured JSON output (run metadata, calls, artifacts, scores)
  - Bounded loops to prevent runaway execution
- **Usage**: `dotnet run --project ProjectName.McpClient -- --config intents/intent.json`

### 2. Node Orchestration Scripts (scripts)
- **Master Orchestrator** (orchestrate.js): Coordinates the entire PMCR-O loop
  - Validates structure, runs self-assessment, triggers evolution
  - Can generate intents on-the-fly via env vars
  - Produces reports and updates metrics
- **Specialized Scripts**:
  - `validate-structure.js`: Checks doc completeness and cross-references
  - `self-assess.js`: Computes quality scores
  - `evolution-triggers.js`: Identifies improvement opportunities
  - `generate-intent.js`: Creates intents from descriptions

### 3. Intent System (intents)
- **Purpose**: Declarative JSON configs defining tool call sequences
- **Structure**:
  ```json
  {
    "server": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-everything"] },
    "calls": [
      { "tool": "echo", "params": { "message": "step 1" } },
      { "tool": "echo", "params": { "message": "{{last.Text}} + step 2" } }
    ],
    "out": "out/result.json"
  }
  ```
- **Templating**: Supports `{{last.Text}}`, `{{Calls[i].Text}}` for chaining outputs

### 4. Template-Driven Generation
- **Template** (template.intent.json): Base structure with placeholders
- **Generator** (generate-intent.js): Fills templates with generic steps
- **Example**: `node generate-intent.js "my app idea" "my-app" 5`
  - Creates intent with 5 steps analyzing the idea from different angles

### 5. Documentation System (docs)
- **DocFX Site**: Self-referential docs with philosophy, guides, and reports
- **Philosophy** (philosophy): O-dash-O, PMCR-O, strange loops, etc.
- **Guides** (guides): Usage patterns, orchestration, memory, etc.
- **Meta** (meta): Docs map, AI runbook for self-improvement
- **Self-Assessment**: Every doc includes quality checks and evolution triggers

### 6. Memory & Persistence (mydatabase.db)
- **SQLite Schema**: Tables for runs, steps, artifacts, metrics
- **Purpose**: Store structured outputs for retrieval, analytics, and provenance
- **Ingestion**: Scripts parse `out/*.result.json` and upsert to DB
- **Queries**: Track evolution, reuse successful patterns, detect drift

## 🚀 How to Use It

### 1. Generate an Intent
```bash
# From description
node scripts/generate-intent.js "build a task management app" "task-app" 6

# Or via orchestration
INTENT_DESCRIPTION="my idea" INTENT_NAME="my-intent" node scripts/orchestrate.js
```

### 2. Run the Intent
```powershell
dotnet run --project src/ProjectName.McpClient -- --config intents/intent.task-app.json
```

### 3. Persist Results
```javascript
// In Node script
const ingest = require('./scripts/ingest-results.js');
ingest('out/intent.task-app.result.json');
```

### 4. Orchestrate & Evolve
```bash
node scripts/orchestrate.js  # Runs full PMCR-O loop
```

### 5. Analyze & Improve
```sql
-- Query SQLite for insights
SELECT run_id, score FROM steps ORDER BY score DESC;
```

## 🎯 Key Benefits

- **Deterministic**: Bounded steps, structured outputs, no unbounded AI calls
- **Portable**: Canonical envelope works across tools/languages
- **Self-Improving**: Docs assess themselves, system evolves via triggers
- **Composable**: Intents can chain outputs, orchestrate complex workflows
- **Provenanced**: Every artifact locked with hashes and timestamps

## 🔧 What Makes It Unique

Unlike typical MCP setups, ThoughtTransfer:
- **Embodies its philosophy**: The system practices what it preaches (self-reference)
- **Goes beyond tools**: Includes full development lifecycle with docs, memory, evolution
- **Is declarative**: High-level intents generate detailed plans automatically
- **Maintains context**: Locked provenance prevents drift across iterations
- **Scales patterns**: From simple echoes to full app development workflows

This creates a **living framework** that can teach itself to build better software through recursive improvement cycles.
