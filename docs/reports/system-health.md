## PMCR-O Loop Execution
- Planner: Choose health metrics and thresholds.
- Maker: Collect and compute values deterministically.
- Checker: Compare against thresholds; flag issues.
- Reflector: Recommend improvements and track deltas.
- Orchestrator: Schedule remediation tasks and rechecks.

## Evolution Triggers
- If completeness < 80%: prioritize docs fixes and validations.
- If reliability < 95%: investigate build/test flakiness.
- If debt > 30%: schedule refactors with measurable outcomes.

## Meta-Commentary
- Meta-Note: This page declares its loop and meta so automation can validate and evolve it.
