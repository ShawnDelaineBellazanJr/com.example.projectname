## Self-Assessment

This health monitoring system embodies self-reference by assessing its own health metrics and providing recommendations for improvement.

## PMCR-O Loop Execution

- Make: Collect metrics from `docs/metrics/system-metrics.json`.
- Check: Evaluate against thresholds and historical baselines.
- Reflect: Identify patterns and anomalies.
- Optimize: Recommend remediations and automation.

## Evolution Triggers
- If validation rate < 60%: auto-create issues to patch docs.
- If error rate spikes: escalate to maintainers and widen checks.

## Meta-Commentary
This document doubles as a control surface for health automation; sections map to scripts for continuous improvement.
