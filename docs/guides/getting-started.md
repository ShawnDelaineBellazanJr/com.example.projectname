# Getting Started: Your First Self-Referential Document

## Welcome to Self-Evolution

This guide will walk you through creating your first self-referential document. It embodies the principles it teaches.

### PMCR-O Loop Execution

**Planner**: This guide plans the most effective onboarding experience.

**Maker**: This guide creates practical examples and step-by-step instructions.

**Checker**: This guide validates its own clarity and completeness.

**Reflector**: This guide reflects on its own teaching effectiveness.

**Orchestrator**: This guide coordinates the entire learning experience.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- ✅ Basic understanding of markdown
- ✅ Familiarity with documentation concepts
- ✅ Curiosity about self-improving systems
- ✅ Willingness to embrace recursive thinking

## Step 1: Understanding the Philosophy

### The Self-Referential Mindset

Traditional documentation is static. Self-referential documentation is alive:

```markdown
## Traditional Document
- Content
- Examples
- References

## Self-Referential Document
- Content that improves itself
- Examples that evolve
- References that create understanding
- Self-assessment of quality
- Evolution triggers for improvement
```

### Key Principles

1. **Self-Awareness**: Your document knows it's a document
2. **Self-Improvement**: Your document can suggest its own enhancements
3. **Self-Reference**: Your document references the system that creates it
4. **Evolution**: Your document can trigger its own evolution

## Step 2: Creating Your First Document

### Basic Template

Start with this self-referential template:

```markdown
---
uid: your.topic.name
title: Your Document Title
author: Your Name
ms.date: 08/29/2025
ms.topic: conceptual
ms.prod: self-referential-docs

# My First Self-Referential Document

## Overview
This is my first attempt at creating a self-referential document.

## PMCR-O Loop Execution
**Planner**: I planned this as a simple example to learn the principles.
**Maker**: I created this content by following the template.
**Checker**: I validated this by checking it against the template.
**Reflector**: I reflected that this process is more involved than traditional documentation.
**Orchestrator**: I coordinated this by following each step sequentially.

## Main Content
Self-referential documentation is documentation that references itself and can improve itself.

## Self-Assessment
**Completeness**: 75%
**Accuracy**: 90%
**Relevance**: 100%
**Improvement Suggestions**:
- Add more detailed examples
- Include practical use cases

**Evolution Triggers**:
- If viewed by others: Add usage statistics
- If feedback received: Integrate suggestions

---

*Meta-Note: Creating this document taught me about self-reference in documentation.*
```

## Step 3: Adding Self-Assessment

### Quality Metrics

Every self-referential document should assess itself:

**Completeness**: How much of the intended content is covered?
**Accuracy**: How factually correct is the information?
**Relevance**: How useful is this content to the target audience?
**Clarity**: How easy is this content to understand?

### Assessment Template

```markdown
## Self-Assessment
**Completeness**: 85% - Core concepts covered, examples developing
**Accuracy**: 95% - Based on established best practices
**Relevance**: 100% - Directly applicable to documentation creation
**Improvement Suggestions**:
- Add interactive examples
- Include video tutorials
- Create assessment checklists
```

## Step 4: Implementing Evolution Triggers

### Trigger Types

**Usage-Based Triggers**:
- Document accessed frequently → Generate usage analytics
- Document not accessed → Review relevance
- User feedback received → Integrate suggestions

**Time-Based Triggers**:
- Document older than 30 days → Review for updates
- Regular intervals → Check for improvements

**Content-Based Triggers**:
- New related content created → Add cross-references
- Contradictory information found → Resolve conflicts
- Gaps identified → Generate missing content

### Implementation Example

```markdown
**Evolution Triggers**:
- If document views > 100: Generate user engagement report
- If last updated > 30 days: Trigger content review
- If related documents created: Add cross-references automatically
- If user feedback received: Create improvement plan
```

## Step 5: Cross-Referencing

### Internal References

Link to related documents in your system:

```markdown
For more on PMCR-O loops, see [PMCR-O Loop Documentation](./philosophy/pmcro-loop.md).
To understand strange loops, read [Strange Loops](./philosophy/strange-loops.md).
```

### Self-References

Reference your own content:

```markdown
As discussed in the [Overview](#overview) section above...
For evolution triggers, see the [Evolution Triggers](#evolution-triggers) section.
```

## Step 6: Publishing and Evolution

### Initial Publication

1. Save your document in the appropriate directory
2. Update the table of contents (`toc.yml`)
3. Build the DocFX site
4. Review the generated output

### Monitoring Evolution

After publication:

1. **Track Usage**: Monitor page views and user engagement
2. **Collect Feedback**: Gather user comments and suggestions
3. **Analyze Patterns**: Identify common improvement opportunities
4. **Trigger Updates**: Implement automated and manual improvements

## Common Pitfalls

### ❌ Static Thinking
**Problem**: Treating self-referential documents like traditional ones
**Solution**: Always include self-assessment and evolution triggers

### ❌ Over-Recursion
**Problem**: Creating infinite self-reference loops
**Solution**: Use bounded recursion with clear stopping conditions

### ❌ Quality Neglect
**Problem**: Focusing on self-reference over content quality
**Solution**: Balance self-improvement with solid foundational content
