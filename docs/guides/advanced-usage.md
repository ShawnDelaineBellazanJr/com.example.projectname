# Advanced Usage Patterns

## Overview

This guide covers advanced patterns and techniques for leveraging the full potential of the self-referential documentation system, including custom evolution triggers, advanced orchestration, and system customization.

## Advanced Orchestration

### Custom Evolution Triggers

#### Creating Custom Triggers
```javascript
// Example: Custom trigger for content freshness
const customTrigger = {
  name: 'content_freshness',
  condition: (document) => {
    const age = Date.now() - document.lastModified;
    return age > 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000; // 30 days
  },
  action: (document) => {
    addFreshnessWarning(document);
    scheduleReview(document);
  },
  priority: 'medium'
};
```

#### Trigger Categories
- **Quality Triggers**: Monitor and improve content quality
- **Engagement Triggers**: Boost user engagement and interaction
- **Freshness Triggers**: Ensure content remains current and relevant
- **Integration Triggers**: Maintain system coherence and cross-references

### Advanced Assessment Configuration

#### Custom Quality Metrics
```javascript
const customMetrics = {
  technicalAccuracy: {
    weight: 0.25,
    criteria: ['code_examples', 'api_references', 'technical_correctness']
  },
  userExperience: {
    weight: 0.20,
    criteria: ['navigation', 'searchability', 'accessibility']
  }
};
```

#### Assessment Automation
- **Scheduled Assessments**: Regular quality checks
- **Event-Driven Assessment**: Trigger assessments based on changes
- **Comparative Analysis**: Compare documents against benchmarks
- **Trend Analysis**: Track quality improvements over time

## System Customization

### Custom Templates

#### Self-Assessment Template
```markdown
## Self-Assessment

**Completeness**: [X]% - [Brief explanation]
**Accuracy**: [X]% - [Brief explanation]
**Relevance**: [X]% - [Brief explanation]
**Quality**: [X]% - [Brief explanation]

**Overall Score**: [X]/100

**Improvement Priority**: [High/Medium/Low]
```

#### Evolution Trigger Template
```markdown
## Evolution Triggers

- If [condition]: [action]
- If [condition]: [action]
- If [condition]: [action]
- If [condition]: [action]
```

### Advanced Configuration

#### DocFX Customization
```json
{
  "build": {
    "globalMetadata": {
      "_appTitle": "Custom Documentation System",
      "_enableSearch": true,
      "_enableNewTab": true,
      "_customEvolutionEnabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

#### Script Configuration
```javascript
// Custom configuration for assessment engine
const config = {
  assessment: {
    thresholds: {
      excellent: 90,
      good: 70,
      fair: 50
    },
    weights: {
      completeness: 0.3,
      accuracy: 0.3,
      relevance: 0.2,
      quality: 0.2
    }
  }
};
```

## Performance Optimization

### Build Optimization
- **Incremental Builds**: Only rebuild changed content
- **Parallel Processing**: Process multiple documents simultaneously
- **Caching Strategies**: Cache assessment results and reports
- **Lazy Loading**: Load content on demand

### Assessment Optimization
- **Selective Assessment**: Only assess recently changed documents
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple assessments together
- **Result Caching**: Cache assessment results to avoid recalculation
- **Smart Scheduling**: Schedule assessments during low-usage periods

## Integration Patterns

### External System Integration
- **Version Control**: Integrate with Git for change tracking
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automate assessment and evolution in build pipelines
- **User Analytics**: Integrate user behavior data for evolution decisions
- **Content Management**: Connect with CMS systems for content updates

### API Integration
```javascript
// Example: Integration with external assessment service
const externalAssessment = {
  endpoint: 'https://api.example.com/assess',
  headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer token' },
  transformResult: (result) => ({
    score: result.quality_score,
    suggestions: result.improvements
  })
};
```

## Troubleshooting Advanced Issues

### Common Problems

#### Assessment Accuracy Issues
- **Symptom**: Assessment scores don't match expectations
- **Solution**: Review assessment criteria and weights
- **Prevention**: Regular validation of assessment algorithms

#### Evolution Trigger Conflicts
- **Symptom**: Multiple triggers firing simultaneously
- **Solution**: Implement trigger prioritization and conflict resolution
- **Prevention**: Design triggers with clear scope and conditions

#### Performance Degradation
- **Symptom**: System slows down with large document sets
- **Solution**: Implement caching and optimization strategies
- **Prevention**: Monitor performance metrics and scale appropriately

## Self-Assessment

**Completeness**: 80% - Core advanced patterns covered, examples provided
**Accuracy**: 85% - Based on current system capabilities and best practices
**Relevance**: 90% - Addresses advanced user needs and system customization
**Quality**: 85% - Clear structure, comprehensive examples, practical guidance

**Overall Score**: 85/100

## Evolution Triggers

- If new integration patterns emerge: Add corresponding documentation
- If performance issues arise: Update optimization strategies
- If user needs evolve: Expand advanced usage patterns
- If system capabilities grow: Add new advanced features

## PMCR-O Loop Execution
- Plan: Define advanced goals and success signals.
- Make: Orchestrate multi-step flows and parallel assistants.
- Check: Measure latency, correctness, and resiliency.
- Reflect: Document trade-offs and alternatives.
- Optimize: Tune prompts, caching, and retries.
