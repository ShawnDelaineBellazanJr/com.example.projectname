# Best Practices

## Overview

This guide outlines best practices for creating, maintaining, and evolving self-referential documentation that embodies PMCR-O loop principles and maintains high quality standards.

## Content Creation

### Document Structure Standards

#### Required Sections
Every document should include:
1. **Overview**: Clear introduction and purpose statement
2. **Core Content**: Main concepts, examples, and explanations
3. **Self-Assessment**: Quality evaluation and scoring
4. **Evolution Triggers**: Improvement opportunities and conditions
5. **Cross-References**: Links to related content

#### Section Guidelines
```markdown
# Document Title

## Overview
Brief description of the document's purpose and scope.

## Core Content
Main content with clear headings, examples, and explanations.

## Self-Assessment
Quality evaluation following standard metrics.

## Evolution Triggers
Specific conditions and actions for improvement.

## Cross-References
Links to related documents and concepts.
```

### Writing Standards

#### Clarity and Precision
- Use clear, concise language
- Define technical terms on first use
- Provide practical examples for concepts
- Include code samples where applicable

#### Consistency
- Follow consistent heading hierarchy
- Use standard formatting for lists and tables
- Maintain consistent terminology
- Apply uniform styling across documents

## Quality Assurance

### Self-Assessment Best Practices

#### Scoring Guidelines
- **Completeness**: Does the document cover all necessary topics?
- **Accuracy**: Is all information technically correct and current?
- **Relevance**: Does this address current user needs and contexts?
- **Quality**: Is the structure clear and content engaging?

#### Assessment Frequency
- **New Documents**: Assess immediately after creation
- **Updated Documents**: Re-assess after significant changes
- **Regular Review**: Monthly assessment of core documents
- **Automated Checks**: Continuous monitoring via scripts

### Evolution Trigger Design

#### Trigger Best Practices
- **Specific Conditions**: Clear, measurable criteria for activation
- **Actionable Improvements**: Specific steps for enhancement
- **Appropriate Priority**: High for critical issues, medium for improvements
- **Realistic Scope**: Achievable improvements within reasonable timeframes

#### Example Triggers
```markdown
## Evolution Triggers

- If completeness drops below 80%: Add missing sections and examples
- If technical accuracy becomes outdated: Review and update API references
- If user engagement decreases: Improve examples and practical applications
- If cross-references become broken: Update links and verify connections
```

## Maintenance Practices

### Regular Maintenance Tasks

#### Weekly Tasks
- Run automated assessment scripts
- Review assessment reports and act on high-priority issues
- Update cross-references as needed
- Monitor system health metrics

#### Monthly Tasks
- Complete system-wide assessment
- Review evolution trigger effectiveness
- Update outdated technical information
- Analyze user engagement patterns

#### Quarterly Tasks
- Comprehensive content audit
- Review and update best practices
- Assess system evolution effectiveness
- Plan major improvements and updates

### Version Control Best Practices

#### Commit Guidelines
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Group related changes together
- Reference issue numbers when applicable
- Include assessment results in commit messages

#### Branch Strategy
- Use feature branches for major changes
- Create assessment branches for quality improvements
- Maintain a stable main branch
- Use pull requests for review and integration

## Collaboration Guidelines

### Team Collaboration
- **Shared Standards**: Agree on documentation standards and practices
- **Regular Reviews**: Peer review of new and updated documents
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Share best practices and lessons learned
- **Feedback Integration**: Incorporate user and team feedback

### Contribution Process
1. **Planning**: Discuss changes and assess impact
2. **Implementation**: Create content following standards
3. **Self-Assessment**: Evaluate quality before submission
4. **Peer Review**: Get feedback from team members
5. **Integration**: Merge changes and update references

## Performance Optimization

### Content Optimization
- **Modular Structure**: Break complex topics into manageable sections
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Present information in digestible chunks
- **Visual Elements**: Use diagrams, tables, and formatting for clarity
- **Search Optimization**: Include relevant keywords and metadata

### System Performance
- **Build Optimization**: Use incremental builds and caching
- **Assessment Efficiency**: Optimize assessment scripts for speed
- **Content Delivery**: Optimize for fast loading and navigation
- **Monitoring**: Track performance metrics and user experience

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Quality Decline
- **Issue**: Assessment scores dropping over time
- **Solution**: Implement regular review cycles and automated monitoring
- **Prevention**: Build quality checks into the creation process

#### Broken References
- **Issue**: Cross-references becoming outdated or broken
- **Solution**: Regular link checking and automated validation
- **Prevention**: Use relative paths and automated reference management

#### Content Drift
- **Issue**: Content becoming inconsistent across documents
- **Solution**: Regular content audits and standardization reviews
- **Prevention**: Establish and maintain content standards

## Self-Assessment

**Completeness**: 90% - Comprehensive best practices covered
**Accuracy**: 95% - Based on proven documentation practices
**Relevance**: 90% - Addresses real-world documentation challenges
**Quality**: 90% - Clear structure, practical examples, actionable guidance

**Overall Score**: 91/100

## Evolution Triggers

- If new best practices emerge: Add to this guide and update standards
- If team size changes: Adjust collaboration guidelines accordingly
- If technology evolves: Update technical standards and practices
- If user feedback indicates gaps: Add new best practice categories

## Cross-References

- [Getting Started](getting-started.md) - Basic setup and initial usage
- [Advanced Usage](advanced-usage.md) - Advanced patterns and techniques
- [Evolution Mechanisms](../evolution/mechanisms.md) - How the system evolves
- [Quality Assurance](../evolution/quality-assurance.md) - Quality processes

## PMCR-O Loop Execution
- Plan: Define success criteria and guardrails.
- Make: Apply practices iteratively.
- Check: Measure outcomes with `scripts/self-assess.js`.
- Reflect: Document deltas in CHANGELOG.
- Optimize: Tighten or relax practices based on evidence.

## Meta-Commentary
This section ensures practices remain living guidance and align with the self-referential validation.
