# Contributing to the Self-Referential Documentation Framework

## Overview

This contribution guide embodies the self-referential principles it teaches. It is both instruction and example of effective contribution.

### PMCR-O Loop Execution

**Planner**: This guide plans how to onboard new contributors effectively.

**Maker**: This guide creates practical contribution workflows and examples.

**Checker**: This guide validates its own contribution instructions.

**Reflector**: This guide reflects on its own contribution process.

**Orchestrator**: This guide coordinates the entire contribution experience.

## Getting Started

### 1. Understand the Philosophy

Read our core documentation:
- [Philosophy Overview](philosophy/overview.md)
- [PMCR-O Loop](philosophy/pmcro-loop.md)
- [Strange Loops](philosophy/strange-loops.md)

### 2. Set Up Development Environment

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/thought-transfer.git
cd thought-transfer

# Install DocFX
dotnet tool install -g docfx

# Build the documentation site
docfx build
```

### 3. Create Your First Contribution

```bash
# Create a new branch
git checkout -b feature/your-contribution

# Create a new document
cp docs/templates/self-referential-template.md docs/your-new-doc.md

# Edit the document with your content
# Include self-assessment and evolution triggers

# Build and test
docfx build
docfx serve
```
