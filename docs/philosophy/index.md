# Philosophy Index

> Comment (Plan): This index orients readers, links to core concepts, and embeds self‑assessment and evolution triggers.

Welcome to the Philosophy section. These pages explain the principles behind ThoughtTransfer’s self‑referential, self‑improving design and how they drive practical engineering.

## Start here

- Overview: high‑level philosophy and why self‑reference matters → [Philosophy Overview](./overview.md)
- PMCR‑O Loop: the operating cycle (Plan→Make→Check→Reflect→Optimize) → [PMCR‑O Loop](./pmcro-loop.md)
- O‑dash‑O (O‑O): topologies for thought orchestration → [O‑dash‑O](./o-dash-o.md)
- Strange Loops: how self‑reference creates emergent understanding → [Strange Loops](./strange-loops.md)
- Self‑Reference: patterns, pitfalls, and guardrails → [Self‑Reference](./self-reference.md)
- Consciousness Evolution: speculative lens for system growth → [Consciousness Evolution](./consciousness.md)
- Philosophers & Roles: design lenses mapped to engineering → [Philosophers](./philosophers.md)
- Glossary: definitions you can cite and teach → [Glossary](./glossary.md)

## How philosophy maps to practice

- PMCR‑O maps to repo automation: validate → assess → evolve (see scripts and reports).
- O‑O maps to MCP intents: chain/tree/graph/orchestrator/optimizer are shapes of calls[] and loops.
- Strange loops map to documentation that critiques and improves itself.

## Self‑assessment

- Completeness: Are all core concepts linked with 1–2 line summaries? Do links work? 
- Accuracy: Do definitions align with API and orchestration scripts?
- Relevance: Does each link connect to a practical counterpart (guide/API)?
- Quality: Is the index skimmable in under 60 seconds?

Target ≥85% on the automated quality checks.

## Evolution triggers

- If any linked page lacks self‑assessment: open an issue and inject a checklist.
- If glossary grows > 200 terms: split into themed sub‑glossaries.
- If usage analytics show high exits here: add a 30‑second “tour” video link.
- If concepts change in code (e.g., intent schema): schedule a philosophy refresh.

> Comment (Check): This index routes to all major philosophy topics and their practical mappings.

> Comment (Reflect): Readers should leave with a mental map and clear next clicks.

> Comment (Optimize): Add mini “why it matters” badges next to each link in the next revision.

## PMCR-O Loop Execution
- Planner: Curate core links and summaries.
- Maker: Keep sections brief and actionable.
- Checker: Test links and alignment with guides.
- Reflector: Adjust based on analytics and feedback.
- Orchestrator: Coordinate updates across philosophy pages.

## Meta-Commentary
- Meta-Note: The index embeds its loop to sustain coherence with the rest of the docs.
