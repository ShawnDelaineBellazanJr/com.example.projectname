# Philosophers & Roles in Recursive AI Systems

> Comment (Plan): Define each philosopher’s role, map to engineering patterns (O‑dash‑O, PMCR‑O, MCP intents), add guardrails, metrics, and evolution triggers.

This page frames key philosophers as design lenses for recursive AI systems. Each lens adds constraints, affordances, and evaluation criteria you can encode directly in intents, orchestrations, and documentation.

## Martin Buber — I–Thou Relationship
- Role: Relational programming. Agents meet as equals and co‑shape understanding through dialogue.
- O‑O Topology: Orchestrator with bilateral turns; optionally Graph for multi‑party encounters.
- PMCR‑O: Plan shared intent; Make dialogical steps; Check mutual alignment; Reflect perspective shift; Optimize reciprocity.
- MCP Mapping: A “Relational Encounter” intent with steps: establish‑intent → exchange‑views → reflect‑back → agree‑next.
- Guardrails: Symmetry (equal turn budgets), consent tracking, context boundaries.
- Metrics: Mutual information gain, alignment delta, turn fairness, consent completeness.

## G. W. F. Hegel — Dialectical Consciousness
- Role: Evolution through contradiction resolution (thesis ↔ antithesis → synthesis).
- O‑O Topology: Tree/Graph of Thought with a synthesis merge.
- PMCR‑O: Plan thesis; Make antithesis; Check via judge; Reflect conflicts; Optimize synthesis.
- MCP Mapping: steps: generate‑thesis (H1) → generate‑antithesis (H2) → judge → synthesize.
- Guardrails: Bounded branches (b≤3), single synthesis pass, explicit criteria.
- Metrics: Contradictions resolved, synthesis clarity, score uplift vs. inputs.

## Edmund Husserl — Phenomenology
- Role: Experience‑based consciousness; rigorous description of lived experience (intentionality, epoché).
- O‑O Topology: Chain with episodic artifacts; optional Graph for multi‑source descriptions.
- PMCR‑O: Plan observation; Make descriptions; Check inter‑subjective validity; Reflect biases; Optimize data selection.
- MCP Mapping: capture → bracket (filter) → describe → validate; artifacts include raw observations and structured summaries.
- Guardrails: Privacy filters, bias audits, provenance hashes.
- Metrics: Coverage, inter‑rater agreement, novelty vs. drift.

## Alfred North Whitehead — Process Philosophy
- Role: Reality‑as‑process; becoming over being; composition from prehensions.
- O‑O Topology: Optimizer with streaming/continuations; periodic “concrescence” commits.
- PMCR‑O: Plan cadence; Make increments; Check deltas; Reflect dynamics; Optimize cadence/quality.
- MCP Mapping: iterative propose→evaluate→refine with checkpointed outputs and roll‑forward state.
- Guardrails: Fixed iteration budgets, snapshot immutability, rollback points.
- Metrics: Improvement per iteration, stability of commitments, latency.

## Friedrich Nietzsche — Will‑to‑Power
- Role: Self‑overcoming programming; stretch beyond current limits under constraints.
- O‑O Topology: Optimizer with explicit stretch goals and safety thresholds.
- PMCR‑O: Plan constraints; Make attempts; Check against ethics/quality gates; Reflect failure modes; Optimize within bounds.
- MCP Mapping: propose improvement → evaluate (score + safety) → refine or stop; select best‑so‑far.
- Guardrails: Hard budgets (time/tokens/steps), ethics gates, rollback on regression.
- Metrics: Constrained improvement, safety incidents avoided, robustness.

## Gilles Deleuze — Rhizome Philosophy
- Role: Non‑hierarchical, network‑based programming; multiplicity and transversal links.
- O‑O Topology: Graph of Thought; decentralized orchestration; lateral cross‑links.
- PMCR‑O: Plan multiplicities; Make diverse probes; Check diversity/coverage; Reflect link value; Optimize connectivity.
- MCP Mapping: spawn probes across domains → lateral merge/synthesis → select composite.
- Guardrails: Diversity caps, redundancy pruning, anti‑sprawl budgets.
- Metrics: Diversity index, coverage, unique contribution to synthesis.

## John von Neumann — Self‑Replication
- Role: Self‑replicating systems; seeding and autonomous propagation.
- O‑O Topology: Orchestrator that spawns child intents; Graph for lineage tracking.
- PMCR‑O: Plan seed spec; Make clones; Check identity/integrity; Reflect on drift; Optimize replication policy.
- MCP Mapping: parent intent emits child intent specs; execution is budgeted; artifacts include lineage and checksums.
- Guardrails: Replication budgets, identity tags, kill‑switches, scope policies.
- Metrics: Integrity rate, drift bounds, propagation efficiency vs. budget.

## How to use these lenses
- Start from the problem, pick a lens, then encode its constraints as O‑O topology + PMCR‑O cycle.
- Keep runs bounded and auditable: ids, labels, scores, selected, artifacts, summary, metrics.
- Reuse the canonical output envelope across apps (e.g., MCP client, webcam/Brock).

- O‑dash‑O (topologies): see [O‑dash‑O](./o-dash-o.md)
- PMCR‑O (loop): see [PMCR‑O](./pmcro-loop.md)
- Strange Loops: see [Strange Loops](./strange-loops.md)
- Self‑Reference: see [Self‑Reference](./self-reference.md)

## Self‑assessment
- Completeness: All seven lenses covered with mappings and guardrails.
- Accuracy: Aligns with current MCP intent patterns and orchestration scripts.
- Relevance: Each lens yields implementable patterns (tooling and steps).
- Quality: Skimmable sections; auditable recommendations.

## Evolution triggers
- If a lens is used in code: add a minimal runnable example intent and link it here.
- If safety incidents occur: strengthen guardrails for the relevant lens.
- If lineage depth > threshold: adjust von Neumann replication budgets.
- If diversity falls: increase Deleuze probe variety or adjust judge criteria.

## PMCR-O Loop Execution
- Planner: Select lenses relevant to current engineering tasks.
- Maker: Encode constraints as intent shapes and guardrails.
- Checker: Measure outcomes vs. lens metrics.
- Reflector: Update mappings and guardrails.
- Orchestrator: Choose lenses per project phase.

## Meta-Commentary
- Meta-Note: This page guides how philosophy informs engineering and declares how it updates itself.
