# Philosophy Glossary

> Comment (Plan): Provide succinct, citable definitions; cross‑link to deep dives; enable self‑assessment and evolution.

## O‑dash‑O (O‑O)
An umbrella for thought orchestration topologies: Chain, Tree, Graph, Orchestrator, Optimizer. See: [O‑dash‑O](./o-dash-o.md).

## PMCR‑O Loop
Operational cycle: Plan → Make → Check → Reflect → Optimize. See: [PMCR‑O](./pmcro-loop.md).

## Chain of Thought (CoT)
Linear, bounded reasoning steps; each step builds on the previous. See: [O‑dash‑O](./o-dash-o.md#formal-definitions).

## Tree of Thought (ToT)
Branching hypotheses with evaluation and selection under a budget. See: [O‑dash‑O](./o-dash-o.md#formal-definitions).

## Graph of Thought (GoT)
Interconnected branches with merges/syntheses; a DAG with merge nodes. See: [O‑dash‑O](./o-dash-o.md#formal-definitions).

## Orchestrator (of Thought)
Meta‑controller that schedules child runs and aggregates artifacts. See: [O‑dash‑O](./o-dash-o.md#formal-definitions).

## Optimizer (of Thought)
Bounded iterative improve‑evaluate‑refine process with termination. See: [O‑dash‑O](./o-dash-o.md#formal-definitions).

## Strange Loop
Self‑reference that creates emergent meaning across levels. See: [Strange Loops](./strange-loops.md).

## Self‑Reference
When a system describes or modifies itself; foundational to ThoughtTransfer. See: [Self‑Reference](./self-reference.md).

## Living Documentation
Docs that assess, improve, and evolve themselves through PMCR‑O and automation. See: [Meta Framework](../meta/framework.md).

## Self‑assessment
- Completeness: Are all core concepts listed with links?
- Accuracy: Do definitions match the detailed pages?
- Relevance: Are terms scoped to this project’s philosophy?
- Quality: Is each entry definitional, not narrative?

## Evolution triggers
- If a concept page changes title/anchor: update links here.
- If two terms overlap: merge or clarify distinctions.
- If new patterns emerge in code: add a term with a cross‑link.
