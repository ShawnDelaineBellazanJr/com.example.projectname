# Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What is the Self-Referential Documentation Framework?

The Self-Referential Documentation Framework is a living documentation system that embodies PMCR-O loop principles. It can assess its own quality, identify areas for improvement, and automatically implement enhancements through evolution triggers and orchestration systems.

**Key Features:**
- Automated quality assessment
- Self-improvement through evolution triggers
- Comprehensive orchestration system
- Self-referential content that improves itself

### How does it differ from traditional documentation?

Traditional documentation is static and requires manual updates. Our system is dynamic and self-improving:

| Traditional Documentation | Self-Referential Documentation |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Manual quality assessment | Automated assessment |
| Manual updates required | Automatic improvements |
| Static content structure | Dynamic, evolving content |
| External maintenance | Self-maintaining |
| One-way communication | Interactive, responsive |

### What are PMCR-O loop principles?

PMCR-O stands for:
- **Planner**: Plan improvements and assess needs
- **Maker**: Create and implement improvements
- **Checker**: Validate effectiveness and quality
- **Reflector**: Analyze results and learn from experience
- **Orchestrator**: Coordinate all systems and processes

## Technical Questions

### How does the assessment system work?

The assessment system evaluates documentation across four dimensions:

1. **Completeness** (30%): Content coverage and section completeness
2. **Accuracy** (30%): Technical correctness and factual accuracy
3. **Relevance** (20%): Alignment with user needs and current context
4. **Quality** (20%): Structure, clarity, and overall presentation

Each document includes a self-assessment section that automatically calculates these scores.

### What are evolution triggers?

Evolution triggers are automated mechanisms that activate when certain conditions are met:

```javascript
// Example trigger
{
  name: 'quality_improvement',
  condition: (doc) => doc.score < 80,
  action: 'enhance_quality',
  priority: 'high'
}
```

Triggers can respond to:
- Quality score thresholds
- Content freshness (age-based)
- User engagement patterns
- System health metrics

### How does the orchestration system work?

The master orchestration system coordinates all components:

1. **Planning**: Determines the sequence of operations
2. **Execution**: Runs assessment, evolution, and reporting
3. **Validation**: Ensures all operations completed successfully
4. **Reflection**: Analyzes system effectiveness
5. **Scheduling**: Plans the next orchestration cycle

### Can I integrate it with my existing systems?

Yes! The framework provides multiple integration points:

- **REST APIs** for external system communication
- **Webhooks** for real-time notifications
- **Git integration** for version control workflows
- **CI/CD integration** for automated pipelines
- **Analytics integration** for user behavior tracking

## Usage Questions

### How do I get started?

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/thought-transfer.git
   cd thought-transfer
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the orchestration system**
   ```bash
   npm run orchestrate
   ```

4. **Build the documentation**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. **Serve locally**
   ```bash
   npm run serve
   ```

### How do I create self-referential documentation?

Follow this template for each document:

```markdown
# Document Title

## Overview

## Self-Assessment
**Completeness**: X% - Brief explanation
**Accuracy**: X% - Brief explanation
**Relevance**: X% - Brief explanation
**Quality**: X% - Brief explanation

**Overall Score**: X/100

### How often should I run assessments?

We recommend different assessment frequencies:

- **Continuous**: Automated assessment on content changes
- **Daily**: Quick assessment of recently modified documents
- **Weekly**: Comprehensive assessment of all documentation
- **Monthly**: Full system assessment with trend analysis

### What if assessment scores are low?

Low scores indicate areas for improvement:

1. **Review the assessment breakdown** to identify specific issues
2. **Check evolution triggers** to see if automatic improvements are available
3. **Manual improvements** may be needed for complex issues
4. **Re-assess** after improvements to track progress

## Troubleshooting

### Assessment scripts are not working

**Problem**: Assessment commands fail or produce errors

**Solutions**:
1. Check Node.js installation: `node --version`
2. Verify dependencies: `npm install`
3. Check file permissions on scripts
4. Review error logs for specific issues

### Evolution triggers are not firing

**Problem**: Expected improvements are not happening

**Solutions**:
1. Verify trigger conditions are met
2. Check trigger priority settings
3. Review system health and resource availability
4. Examine evolution logs for error messages

### Build process fails

**Problem**: DocFX build fails with errors

**Solutions**:
1. Install DocFX: `dotnet tool install -g docfx`
2. Check for broken links in TOC
3. Validate all required files exist
4. Clear build cache: `rm -rf _site/`

### Performance is slow

**Problem**: System operations are taking too long

**Solutions**:
1. Enable caching in assessment scripts
2. Implement parallel processing for large document sets
3. Schedule heavy operations during off-peak hours
4. Optimize database queries and file operations

## Advanced Questions

### Can I customize the assessment criteria?

Yes! The assessment system is fully customizable:

```javascript
// Custom assessment configuration
const customConfig = {
  metrics: {
    completeness: { weight: 0.4 },
    accuracy: { weight: 0.3 },
    relevance: { weight: 0.2 },
    quality: { weight: 0.1 }
  },
  customMetrics: {
    userSatisfaction: {
      weight: 0.1,
      evaluate: (content) => /* custom logic */
    }
  }
};
```

### How does the system handle large document repositories?

For large repositories, the system includes:

- **Incremental processing**: Only assess changed documents
- **Parallel execution**: Process multiple documents simultaneously
- **Caching**: Store assessment results to avoid recalculation
- **Batch processing**: Handle large sets efficiently

### Can I extend the evolution trigger system?

Yes! The trigger system is extensible:

```javascript
// Custom trigger implementation
class CustomTrigger {
  constructor(config) {
    this.config = config;
  }

  async evaluate(context) {
    // Custom evaluation logic
    return this.config.condition(context);
  }

  async execute(context) {
    // Custom execution logic
    return await this.config.action(context);
  }
}
```

### What about security and compliance?

The system includes security features:

- **Input validation** for all user inputs
- **Secure API endpoints** with authentication
- **Audit trails** for all changes
- **Compliance logging** for regulatory requirements
- **Access controls** for sensitive operations
