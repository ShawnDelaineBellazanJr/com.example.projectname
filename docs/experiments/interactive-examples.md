# Interactive Documentation Experiments

## Experiment: Self-Executing Examples

This section explores ways to make documentation more interactive.

### Planned Experiments

- [ ] Click-to-run code examples
- [ ] Interactive decision trees
- [ ] Real-time feedback forms
- [ ] Collaborative annotation system

## Current Status

Planning phase - experiments to begin in next iteration.

# Interactive Examples

## PMCR-O Loop Execution
- Plan: Define the goal of the example and expected outcome.
- Make: Execute the steps using configured MCP assistants.
- Check: Verify outputs match expectations and are reproducible.
- Reflect: Capture deviations and usability notes.
- Optimize: Simplify steps and add guardrails if needed.

## Self-Assessment
- Completeness: Do examples cover core flows (docs, validation, MCP)?
- Accuracy: Are steps technically correct and current?
- Relevance: Do they map to common user intents?
- Quality: Are they concise, scannable, and reliable?

## Evolution Triggers
- If example fails in CI or local runs: open an issue and mark flaky.
- If usage analytics show drop-off: simplify or split steps.
- If new servers are added: include fresh examples.

## Meta-Commentary
This page is intentionally self-referential to sustain example reliability across releases.
