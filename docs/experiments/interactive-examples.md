# Interactive Documentation Experiments

## Experiment: Self-Executing Examples

This section explores ways to make documentation more interactive.

### Planned Experiments

- [ ] Click-to-run code examples
- [ ] Interactive decision trees
- [ ] Real-time feedback forms
- [ ] Collaborative annotation system

## Current Status

Planning phase - experiments to begin in next iteration.

---

## PMCR-O Loop Execution
- Planner: Select minimal interactive patterns to implement first.
- Maker: Build click-to-run and decision-tree prototypes.
- Checker: Measure engagement and error rates.
- Reflector: Capture usability issues; simplify flows.
- Orchestrator: Roll out to priority guides and iterate.

## Self-Assessment
- Completeness: Prototype list and plan present. Score: 0.7 (needs examples)
- Accuracy: Feasible within docs site constraints. Score: 0.85
- Relevance: Directly improves docs usability. Score: 0.9
- Quality: Clear but pending implementation. Score: 0.75

## Evolution Triggers
- If engagement < target: add inline run buttons and shorten examples.
- If errors > 2%: add sandbox validation and reset mechanisms.
- If maintenance cost rises: centralize components.

* Meta-Note: This page declares its own loop so experiments remain bounded and auditable.
