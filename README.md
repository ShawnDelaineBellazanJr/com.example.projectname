A living documentation system that embodies self-evolutionary principles through recursive improvement loops, strange loops, and meta-documentation patterns.

## 🧠 Philosophy

This documentation system operates on **PMCR-O Loop** principles:
- **Planner**: Documents plan their own expansion
- **Maker**: Content creates new insights through self-analysis
- **Checker**: Each document validates its own accuracy
- **Reflector**: Meta-reflection on the documentation process
- **Orchestrator**: Coordinates the evolution of the entire system

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 6.0+](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- [DocFX](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/) (`dotnet tool install -g docfx`)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Build the Site

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/thought-transfer.git
cd thought-transfer

# Install DocFX globally
dotnet tool install -g docfx

# Build the documentation site
docfx build

# Serve locally for development
docfx serve _site
```

The site will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

### MCP Setup for AI Development

This project includes a comprehensive MCP (Model Context Protocol) configuration for AI-powered development:

# Configure your API keys (see MCP_SETUP_GUIDE.md)
# - GITHUB_TOKEN for repository access
# - DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING for data storage
# - Additional keys for cloud services, AI APIs, etc.
```

**Available MCP Servers:**
- **Core Development**: filesystem, memory, sequential-thinking, git
- **Database**: SQLite, multi-database support

- **AI & Search**: OpenAI, Brave Search, web scraping
- **Productivity**: Slack, Airtable, Postman, task management

See [MCP Setup Guide](docs/MCP_SETUP_GUIDE.md) for detailed configuration instructions.

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Create a new branch for your changes
git checkout -b feature/your-improvement

# Make your changes to the docs/ directory
# Edit existing files or create new ones following the self-referential template

# Build and preview
docfx build
docfx serve _site

# Run self-assessment and evolution systems
npm run self-assess          # Assess documentation quality
npm run evolution-triggers   # Trigger automated improvements
npm run orchestrate          # Run full orchestration cycle
npm run full-assessment      # Complete assessment pipeline

# Test evolution triggers and self-assessment features
npm run validate-structure   # Validate document structure

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Improve documentation with self-referential enhancements"
git push origin feature/your-improvement
```

### Automated Maintenance

Set up automated maintenance to keep your documentation evolving:

```bash
# Run full maintenance cycle (assessment + evolution + build)
npm run maintenance

# Or run individual components
npm run orchestrate          # Master orchestration system
npm run self-assess          # Quality assessment
npm run evolution-triggers   # Improvement triggers
npm run validate-structure   # Structure validation
```
